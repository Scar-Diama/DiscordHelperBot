This university project tested my ability to apply what I had learned about the Python language by creating a hypothetical Discord Helper bot with a variety of functions. 
It helped me strengthen my understanding of coding fundamentals, including standard practices, naming conventions, and the basic flow of logic.

For safety reasons, TOKENS and other identifiable information have been removed. This repository exists purely to showcase my journey in coding as my first major project.
